# Revamped Portfolio Website

This is my newly revamped portfolio website, developed with React. It showcases my best work, experience, job description, and the skills I've acquired so far.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:KAMO333/Revamped-Portfolio.git
```
Next, navigate to the "portfolio website" folder:
```bash
cd "portfolio website"
```
## Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
## Run the App
Start the development server by running:
```
npm run dev
```
Once the server is running, you can view the website at:
```
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```
## Enjoy browsing the portfolio!
